# sqlalchemy-challenge
 
This is a project made as part of my studies at  UWA bootcamp. In this project I am analysing a data base that contains information about weather in Hawaii to prepare and plan for my next holidays. 

In PART 1 I analyse and explore the Climate Data

I am using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the database. Specifically, I use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

1) Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to my SQLite database.

2) Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect my tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

3) Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

In PART 2 I design a Climate App using Flask
